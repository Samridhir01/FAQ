                What is React ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                React anchors the MERN stack. In some sense, this is the defining component of the MERN stack.
                React is an open-source JavaScript library maintained by Facebook that can be used for creating views
                rendered in HTML. Unlike AngularJS, React is not a framework.

                Why Facebook Invented React ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                React was born not in the Facebook application that we all see, but in Facebook’s Ads organization.
Originally, they used a typical client-side MVC model to start with, which had all the regular two-way data
binding and templates. Views would listen to changes on models, and they would respond to those changes
by updating themselves.

                what is Node.js ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                Node.js is JavaScript outside of a browser. The creators of Node.js just took Chrome’s V8
                JavaScript engine and made it run independently as a JavaScript runtime. If you are familiar with the Java
                runtime that runs Java programs, you can easily relate to the JavaScript runtime: the Node.js runtime runs
                JavaScript programs.

                what is MongoDB ?
            </h3>
            <p class="faq-text">
                MongoDB is the database used in the MERN stack. It is a NoSQL document-oriented database, with a
                flexible schema and a JSON-based query language. Not only do many modern companies (including
                Facebook and Google) use MongoDB in production, but some older established companies such as SAP and
                Royal Bank of Scotland have adopted MongoDB.
